# line lengths:
#   - Excessive line lengths aren't good. But rather then automatically
#     breaking them and turning into vertical blocks we want to see the
#     nastiness sticking out prominently.
#
# black:
#   - If the question is "Black?" the answer is "No!"
#   - We use autopep8 to confirm compliance with PEP8, going beyond that
#     is not necessary. If you want to apply black, then fine, go ahead.
#     But we're not going to enforce or encourage it.
