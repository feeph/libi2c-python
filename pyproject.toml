# quickstart:
#   pdm install
#   pdm run pytest

# dependencies
#   - use `pdm add <package>` and `pdm remove <package>` to manage dependencies
#   - use `pdm add -d -G dev <packag>` to add a dev dependency
#   - use `pdm update --update-all` to update dependencies
#   - use `pdm install` to install dependencies

# usage:
#   - use `pdm run <pythonfile>` to execute code
#   - use `pdm run pytest` to perform unit tests

# line lengths:
#   - Excessive line lengths aren't good. But rather then automatically
#     breaking them and turning into vertical blocks we want to see the
#     nastiness sticking out prominently.
